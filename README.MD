# 🛡️ VAPT Journey: Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my **daily progress on Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**! 💻🔐

### 🚨 Why VAPT?
Cybersecurity is my passion, and I believe the best way to learn is through hands-on practice and real-world labs. In this repository, I’m sharing my daily journey as I explore **VAPT topics**, tackle real-world security challenges, and document my findings.

If you're a beginner or expert in cybersecurity, you're welcome to follow along, learn, and share your suggestions! Let's make this journey interactive and collaborative. 🤝

## 🚀 My Cybersecurity Learning Plan

I am passionate about cybersecurity, and to gain a deeper understanding, I’m starting a **VAPT Tutorial Series with Labs**. I'll be updating this repo with new content **daily**, focusing on practical security concepts, attack vectors, and solutions. 🌱

The majority of the topics I’ll be exploring are based on **PortSwigger's Web Security Academy**, which offers fantastic resources and labs to help learners develop real-world skills. For more practical discussion and hands-on learning, I'll also refer to **Kontra**. 🧑‍💻

### 🔍 What You Can Expect:
- Daily updates with **new blog posts**, findings, and solutions.
- **Hands-on labs** and detailed write-ups on how to exploit and defend against common vulnerabilities.
- **Discussions on mitigation strategies** and security best practices.
- A collaborative environment for **beginners** and **experts** to share ideas, solutions, and suggestions. 😊

If you're starting your journey in cybersecurity, this is the perfect place to follow along. I’ll make sure to explain each topic concisely yet thoroughly, so even if you’re new to VAPT, you'll understand how to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. 🧑‍🎓

### 💡 Are You an Expert or Enthusiast?
If you're an expert in this field, I’d love to collaborate with you! 💪 I’m always open to feedback, suggestions, and ideas to make this series better. Whether you’re looking to help with **suggestions** or **improvements**, feel free to jump in and share your knowledge!

### 🔑 Getting Started:
